Parallax movement is when things move at different speeds relative to each other. It’s a popular effect that can be used to create an illusion of depth. If we’re moving, we see objects close to us move faster than objects further away. The technique is popular in many places including video games, where it’s usually seen in layered backgrounds. In this example, we see how parallax works when the mouse hovers over the layers.
